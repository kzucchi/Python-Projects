#this is similar to my April 2013 javascript rock-paper-scissors project 
#I've added 2 more options and trying it in python


# Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock by KZ


# The key idea of this program is to equate the strings
# "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", "Spock" to numbers
# as follows:
#
# 0 - rock
# 1 - Spock
# 2 - paper
# 3 - lizard
# 4 - scissors

#Rules of the Game:
#scissors cuts paper. paper covers rock.
#rock crushes lizard. lizard poisons spock.
#spock smashes scissors. scissors decapitates lizard.
#lizard eats paper. paper disproves spock.
#spock vaporizes rock and as always rock crushes scissors.

# helper functions
#this function converts name to number using if/elif/else
